There are three simulators associated with testing the new framework.

They include the following...


####Customer Generic Simulator

https://github.com/stormasm/customer-generic-simulator

This is where everything starts out.  This simulates the actual JSON
data we get from the customer.  The key point here is that the customer
only sends a token.  They do not send the account, project, and dbnumber.

####Spinnakr Generic Simulator

https://github.com/stormasm/spinnakr-generic-simulator

This is the simulator that Justin uses to drive his trident processing.
This simulator generates out the account, project and associated dbnumber.

This data can also be generated by reading this:

This is the code MIA uses to test
[tokentransform]
(https://github.com/stormasm/spinnakr-spne/blob/master/test/tokentransform.rb)

####Spinnakr Event Simulator
